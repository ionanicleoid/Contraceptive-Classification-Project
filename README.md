# Contraceptive-Classification-Project
The purpose of this report is to conduct a classification task to predict a womanâ€™s contraceptive method (no use, long-term methods, or short-term use) based on
her demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. This is achieved through the use of R and conducts supervised learning experiments such as Linear Discriminant Analysis,  Support Vector Machine algorithms such as Linear Support Vector Machine, Polynomial Support Vector Machine and Radial Support Vector Machine, with finally using Random Forest to predict contraceptive methods.
